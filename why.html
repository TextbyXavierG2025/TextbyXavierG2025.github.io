<h2>They are loyal</h2>
<p>dogs are SOOOO much better thatn cats because dogs are super loyal and will actually listen to you when you ask them things like telling them to "come here" or "sit" while cats on the other hand will not pay attention to you and get really agressive when you try and get them to do things. </p>
